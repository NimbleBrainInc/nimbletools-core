**Deploy any MCP tool as an auto-scaling production service in 60 seconds**

## Why NimbleTools Core?

### For Developers & DevOps Teams

Turn command-line MCP tools into scalable HTTP services without rewriting a single line of code. Deploy once, scale automatically, pay nothing when idle.

### For Teams & Organizations

Share AI tools across teams from a central platform. No more "works on my machine" - every MCP tool becomes a reliable, discoverable service.

### For the MCP Ecosystem

The MCP ecosystem has powerful tools but inconsistent deployment patterns. NimbleTools Core provides a universal deployment layer that works with any MCP server - stdio or HTTP, Python or Go, simple or complex.

## Quick Start (60 seconds to production)

**Prerequisites:**

- **Kubernetes cluster** (we use k3d for local development)
- **Helm 3.0+** for package management
- **kubectl** configured for your cluster

**Local development setup:**

```bash
# Install k3d for local Kubernetes cluster
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/k3d-io/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

# Create local cluster
k3d cluster create nimbletools-demo --wait
```

**Installation:**

```bash
# Configure local domains for API access
echo "127.0.0.1 api.nimbletools.local mcp.nimbletools.local" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts

# One command gets you running
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nimblebrain/nimbletools-core/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**What just happened?**

- ‚úÖ Kubernetes operator deployed and running
- ‚úÖ REST API available for service management
- ‚úÖ Ready to deploy your first MCP service

**Verify it worked:**

```bash
kubectl get pods -n nimbletools-system
# Should show operator and API pods running
```

**Option 1: Deploy from the Community Registry**

```bash
# Add the community registry (dozens of ready-to-use services)
./scripts/register-community-registry.sh

# Browse available services via API
curl http://api.nimbletools.local/api/v1/registry/servers

# Deploy directly from the registry
# (Services come pre-configured with best practices)
```

**Option 2: Deploy your own service:**

```bash
# NOTE: remember to create workspace with CLI!
kubectl apply -f examples-everything-mcp.yaml
EOF
```

**Success!** üéâ You now have a production MCP service that auto-scales and integrates with any MCP client.

## Choose Your Path

### üÜï New to MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets AI assistants use external tools and data sources. Think of it as "plugins for AI" - but instead of being locked to one AI system, MCP tools work with Claude, ChatGPT, local models, and more.

**What problems does MCP solve?**

- AI assistants can access real-time data (not just training data)
- Tools can be shared across different AI platforms
- Developers can create once, deploy everywhere

**Common MCP tools:** File browsers, database clients, API integrations, calculators, code analyzers, system monitors.

üëâ **Next:** [Try our getting started examples](examples/README.md)

### ‚ö° Experienced with MCP?

Skip the intro - you know MCP tools are powerful but deployment is inconsistent. Every tool has different requirements, some are stdio-only, others HTTP-only, and scaling is a manual nightmare.

**NimbleTools Core solves this by:**

- **Universal Deployment**: stdio tools run via our adapter, HTTP tools run natively
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale from 0 to N replicas automatically
- **Production Ready**: Built-in monitoring, security, and reliability

üëâ **Next:** [Deploy your existing MCP tools](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

### üîß Kubernetes Expert?

You understand the operational complexity of running services at scale. NimbleTools Core provides Kubernetes-native primitives for MCP service lifecycle management.

**Architecture highlights:**

- Custom MCPService CRD with full lifecycle management
- Kubernetes operator pattern for automated operations
- Scale-to-zero with automatic cold-start handling
- Multi-tenant workspace isolation

## Service Discovery Made Easy

### üóÇÔ∏è **MCP Registry: Your Service Marketplace**

**Turn service discovery from hunting to browsing**

Instead of hunting for MCP services across GitHub repos and documentation, browse curated collections of ready-to-deploy services.

```bash
# Add the community registry
./scripts/register-community-registry.sh

# Browse ready-to-use services
curl http://api.nimbletools.local/api/v1/registry/servers | jq '.servers[].name'

# Deploy any service instantly
kubectl create -f registry-community/web-scraper.yaml
```

**What you get:**

- **Tested Services:** Every service is pre-configured and tested
- **Best Practices:** Proper security, scaling, and monitoring built-in
- **One-Click Deploy:** No YAML writing, just select and deploy
- **Community Driven:** Share your services, discover what others built

#### Create Your Own Registry

**For Teams & Organizations:** Create a private registry with your custom MCP services.

```bash
# Fork the registry template
git clone https://github.com/NimbleBrainInc/nimbletools-mcp-registry.git my-company-registry
cd my-company-registry

# Add your services to registry.yaml
# Follow the format in the community registry

# Host on GitHub Pages, S3, or any web server
git push origin main  # If using GitHub Pages

# Register with your NimbleTools Core instance
./scripts/register-community-registry.sh --registry-url https://my-company.github.io/my-company-registry/registry.yaml
```

**Use cases:**

- **Enterprise Service Catalogs:** Curated, approved services for your organization
- **Team-Specific Tools:** Department-specific MCP services and configurations
- **Compliance & Security:** Services that meet your organization's security requirements
- **Custom Business Logic:** Proprietary MCP services for internal processes

# Now any team member can query databases via MCP clients
```

### Serverless MCP Services

Perfect for tools that are used sporadically but need to be always available:

```yaml
spec:
  replicas: 0 # Scales to zero when not in use
  scaling:
    minReplicas: 0
    maxReplicas: 10
```

### Legacy Tool Integration

Have a valuable command-line tool that you want to make available via HTTP?

```yaml
spec:
  deployment:
    type: stdio
    executable: "/usr/local/bin/legacy-tool"
    args: ["--config", "/etc/config.json"]
```

## API Access

Once installed, access the management API:

```bash
# List workspaces
curl http://api.nimbletools.local/api/v1/workspaces

# List services
curl http://api.nimbletools.local/api/v1/workspaces/default/servers

# API documentation
open http://api.nimbletools.local/docs
```
