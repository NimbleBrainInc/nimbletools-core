**Deploy any MCP tool as a production service in 60 seconds**

## Why NimbleTools Core?

### For Developers & DevOps Teams

Turn command-line MCP tools into scalable HTTP services without rewriting a single line of code. Deploy once, scale automatically, pay nothing when idle.

### For Teams & Organizations

Share AI tools across teams from a central platform. No more "works on my machine" - every MCP tool becomes a reliable, discoverable service.

### For the MCP Ecosystem

The MCP ecosystem has powerful tools but inconsistent deployment patterns. NimbleTools Core provides a universal deployment layer that works with any MCP server - stdio or HTTP, Python or Go, simple or complex.

## Quick Start (60 seconds to production)

**Prerequisites:**

- **Helm 3.0+** for package management
- **k3d** for local Kubernetes cluster (automatic setup)

**Installation:**

```bash
# One command gets you running (creates local cluster if needed)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NimbleBrainInc/nimbletools-core/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash
```

**What just happened?**

- ‚úÖ Local Kubernetes cluster created (k3d-nimbletools-quickstart)
- ‚úÖ NimbleTools operator deployed and running
- ‚úÖ REST API available for service management
- ‚úÖ Ready to deploy your first MCP service

**Verify it worked:**

```bash
# Switch to the cluster context
kubectl config use-context k3d-nimbletools-quickstart

# Set namespace for convenience
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=nimbletools-system

# Check that all pods are running
kubectl get pods

# Expected output:
# NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# nimbletools-core-control-plane-64b889fbdb-xxxxx     1/1     Running   0          2m
# nimbletools-core-control-plane-64b889fbdb-xxxxx     1/1     Running   0          2m
# nimbletools-core-operator-7bf4f9f667-xxxxx          1/1     Running   0          2m
# nimbletools-core-rbac-controller-56f67c95dc-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          2m
```

**Deploy your first MCP service:**

```bash
# Fetch the echo server definition from the registry
curl https://registry.nimbletools.ai/v0/servers/ai.nimblebrain%2Fecho > echo-server.json

# Create a workspace
curl -X POST http://api.nimbletools.dev/v1/workspaces \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-workspace", "description": "My first workspace"}'

# Deploy the echo server
curl -X POST http://api.nimbletools.dev/v1/workspaces/my-workspace/servers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @echo-server.json

# Verify the service is running
kubectl get pods -n ws-my-workspace
```

**Success!** üéâ You now have a production MCP service that scales and integrates with any MCP client.

## Choose Your Path

### üÜï New to MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** lets AI assistants use external tools and data sources. Think of it as "plugins for AI" - but instead of being locked to one AI system, MCP tools work with Claude, ChatGPT, local models, and more.

**What problems does MCP solve?**

- AI assistants can access real-time data (not just training data)
- Tools can be shared across different AI platforms
- Developers can create once, deploy everywhere

**Common MCP tools:** File browsers, database clients, API integrations, calculators, code analyzers, system monitors.

### ‚ö° Experienced with MCP?

Skip the intro - you know MCP tools are powerful but deployment is inconsistent. Every tool has different requirements, some are stdio-only, others HTTP-only, and scaling is a manual nightmare.

**NimbleTools Core solves this by:**

- **Universal Deployment**: stdio tools run via our adapter, HTTP tools run natively
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale from 0 to N replicas automatically
- **Production Ready**: Built-in monitoring, security, and reliability

üëâ **Next:** [Deploy your existing MCP tools](docs/QUICKSTART.md)

### üîß Kubernetes Expert?

You understand the operational complexity of running services at scale. NimbleTools Core provides Kubernetes-native primitives for MCP service lifecycle management.

**Architecture highlights:**

- Custom MCPService CRD with full lifecycle management
- Kubernetes operator pattern for automated operations
- Scale-to-zero with automatic cold-start handling
- Multi-tenant workspace isolation

üëâ **Next:** [Architecture deep-dive](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Service Discovery Made Easy

### üóÇÔ∏è **MCP Registry: Your Service Marketplace**

**Turn service discovery from hunting to browsing**

Instead of hunting for MCP services across GitHub repos and documentation, browse curated collections of ready-to-deploy services from the NimbleTools Registry.

```bash
# Browse all available services
curl https://registry.nimbletools.ai/v0/servers | jq '.servers[].name'

# Get details for a specific server
curl https://registry.nimbletools.ai/v0/servers/ai.nimblebrain%2Fecho

# Deploy any service instantly
curl https://registry.nimbletools.ai/v0/servers/ai.nimbletools%2Fecho > echo-server.json
curl -X POST http://api.nimbletools.dev/v1/workspaces/my-workspace/servers \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @echo-server.json
```
